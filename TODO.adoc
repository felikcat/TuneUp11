. `LTSC 2022 Registry\disable_CDM.reg`
** Match this with the new gpedit.msc formatting, and reassess the changes in this file.

. `Non-GPO Registry\quicker_shutdown.reg`
** Needs a reassessment of its contents.

. `Non-GPO Registry\avoid_key_annoyances.reg`
** Needs a reassessment of its contents.

. `W11Boost.bat`
** Do registry backups instead of system restore. Combine this with a script to roll-back non-registry changes to factory defaults.

** Make a pop-up notification when the main (W11Boost.bat) script is done. 

** Descriptions in general need a rework.

** Convert more registry keys to the GPO structure.
