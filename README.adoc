[%collapsible]
.Be specific about what W11Boost does.

====

TIP: RAM usage is higher with some of our performance tweaks, such as enabling NTFS non-paged pool usage.

.Performance
. App or program startups are not tracked.

. Login screen's acrylic blur is disabled.

. Enabled NTFS non-paged pool usage; reduces page-faults and stack usage to lessen DPC latency spikes.

. Enabled DXGI's DirectFlip with multi-plane overlay (MPO) enabled to lower input lag and reduce stuttering in games.

. Disabled the following:
1. Analyzing application execution time.

2. NTFS Last Access Time Stamp Updates; if needed, an application can explicitly update its own access timestamps.

3. Fault Tolerant Heap. FTH severely degrades an application's performance if it got marked for "crashing" too often, such is the case for Assetto Corsa.

4. Explorer's thumbnail shadows. Makes folders with many photos or videos smoother to navigate.

5. Searching disks to attempt fixing a missing shortcut.

. Disabled various forms of telemetry:

1. Visual Studio 2022's PerfWatson2 (VSCEIP).

2. Windows Error Reporting, Connected User Experiences and Telemetry, Diagnostic Policy Service, Cloud Content & Consumer Experience.

3. Advertising ID for apps (.appx packaged).
4. Feedback notifications.


.Reliability
. NTP time sync servers are changed to `time.cloudflare.com ntppool1.time.nl ntppool2.time.nl` to reduce time sync failure.
** Very important for Tor and 2auth/OTP codes from Bitwarden to remain working.
. UAC is enabled for both security, and fixing applications that break from UAC being off, such as Eddie-UI.
. Disabled Fast startup (also called: hybrid shutdown) due to stability issues, and excessive disk usage.

. Disabled 'Wait For Link' on Ethernet adaptors. Can reduce time taken to establish a connection, and prevent drop-outs. Drop-outs were the case with Intel I225-V revision 1 and 2, but not 3.

. Enabled separating explorer.exe, one for the Windows Shell, the other for the File Explorer.

. Game Mode enabled to keep FPS consistent in games in certain situations, such as having OBS Studio recording your games.

. Disabled Microsoft's Malicious Removal Tool, which also has an issue of removing "malicious" files that other anti-virus software like Kaspersky excluded.

. Crash fix for programs using OpenSSL 1.0.2k (Jan 2017) or older; only applied if an Intel CPU is used.

.Usability
. Windows is activated using the KMS38 method if it wasn't activated prior. This also prevents deactivation after hardware changes.

. Installs `winget` if missing or broken.

. Enabled NTFS long paths to prevent issues with Scoop and other programs.

. Ask to enter recovery options after 3 failed boots instead of forcing it.


.Other
. W11Boost's changes are tunneled through the Group Policy Editor, therefore:
- Windows Update does not revert W11Boost's changes.
- W11Boost's changes can be viewed from a graphical interface via `rsop.msc`. +

- Registry changes are non-destructive, as they are easily revertable without relying on System Restore or registry backups.

====

. https://github.com/felikcat/W11Boost/archive/refs/heads/master.zip[Download W11Boost] then extract it.

. Disable your antivirus temporarily, then run `W11Boost_Launcher.bat` as Administrator.

. Wait for the automatic reboot then enjoy.
** Optionally, continue onto the *Extras*.

== Extras

TIP: Login to the Microsoft Store before using `Install_Xbox_Minimal.bat`, otherwise it will not work. +
To also get the Game Bar, install the following link://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NZKPSTSNW4P[here] then link://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NBLGGH537C2[here].

. `W11_LTSC_Replica.bat`
* De-bloats Windows 11 enough to replicate what Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 includes by default, which is known to only include what's important.
*** *Exceptions* to prevent breaking apps or programs: App Installer, Store Experience Host, Windows Store, Xbox Game Speech Window.

. `Install_Xbox_Minimal.bat`
- Installs only what's required to support Xbox Controllers (GUI/interface not included, get it link://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NBLGGH30XJ3[here]), Microsoft's PC Game Pass, and specific games such as Forza Horizon 4 & 5.
- This is made specifically for LTSC or if `W11_LTSC_Replica.bat` was used.

. `Advanced.bat`
** Not meant for usage on PCs you don't personally use.
** Contains extra features, such as removal of Microsoft Edge.
*** Configuring `Advanced.ps1` is required: +
1. Open `Advanced.ps1` in a text editor or IDE of your choosing. +
2. After finished, run `Advanced.bat` as Administrator.

. `Undo_W11Boost.bat`
** Uninstalls W11Boost.

TIP: Star this GitHub repository if you like it, it helps with search engine rankings so more people stumble upon W11Boost. +
I haven't self-promoted W11Boost on social media sites such as YouTube or Discord or TikTok.


== Recommendations

=== BIOS
* *Enable the following:*
. I/O APIC (IOAPIC 24-119 Entries)
. Above 4G Decoding and Resizable BAR.
** On ASRock motherboards: C.A.M. (Clever Access Memory)
** This is incompatible with Windows installed on an MBR partition; if Windows can no longer boot, this setting caused it.
. HPET (High Precision Event Timer)

* *Disable the following:*
. XHCI Hands Off
. USB Legacy
** link://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-usb-blog/reasons-to-avoid-companion-controllers/ba-p/270710[Why disable these two?] +
Note: if a USB is no longer bootable after these two changes, turn them both back on.


=== Windows
. Keep the number of programs installed to a minimum. This reduces your chances of being impacted by https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-compromise-3cx-desktop-app-in-a-supply-chain-attack/[supply chain attacks] and to prevent causing Windows more issues.

. Install all optional updates through Windows Update; it can include device drivers.

. Replace Consumer OEM programs with their Enterprise variant. Such as replacing Lenovo Vantage with Lenovo Commercial Vantage.
