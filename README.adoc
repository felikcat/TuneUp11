A no non-sense Windows 11 optimiser that covers what other tools miss, and avoids overwriting user preferences for the sake of "privacy" (with a few expections).

* Gets rid of some of the auto-piloting that accumulatively is intensive on system resources, such as the link:https://admx.help/?Category=Windows_11_2022&Policy=Microsoft.Policies.ApplicationCompatibility::AppCompatTurnOffEngine[Application Compatibility Engine]; for ACE being off specifically, you would manually specific to run a legacy application in a compatibility mode (likely for Windows XP).

** Above 4G Decoding
** Resizable BAR [NOTE: If Windows cannot boot (due to using MBR instead of GPT), disable this]

* Windows Settings -> Gaming -> Enable "Game Mode"
** -> Graphics -> Change default graphics settings -> Enable "Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling", "Variable refresh rate", and "Optimizations for windowed games"

* Enable "User Account Control" if it's disabled. Disabled will break startup of some software, such as: https://eddie.website/
