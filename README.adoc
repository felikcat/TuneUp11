== About

image:W11Boost_GUI.png[480,360]

Until I readd the "Fix Windows" feature in a future release, W11Boost works best with unmodified Windows installs. +
If you wish to know what W11Boost does, look at the source code, it should be clean enough to understand and every change is documented.

== 0. Creating a full backup of your system
Not required, but it's good hygiene to do so. This might save your ass multiple times in your life.

* Use: https://www.urbackup.org[UrBackup]. You will need another computer to store backups on, but this will end up costing less long-term than services such as Backblaze, plus you completely own your data. 
- Optionally, you can also use https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-backup/personal[Backblaze] for extra redundancy in case of sudden natural disasters, or other situations where you cannot move your backups into a safe location in time.

== 1. If not using Enterprise or LTSC or Education, convert the Windows edition to Education

. Open the Command Prompt as administrator.
. `cscript.exe %windir%\system32\slmgr.vbs /upk`
. `cscript.exe %windir%\system32\slmgr.vbs /ipk NW6C2-QMPVW-D7KKK-3GKT6-VCFB2`
. Use https://github.com/abbodi1406/KMS_VL_ALL_AIO/releases[KMS_VL_ALL_AIO-$version.7z] to activate Windows by installing its auto-renewal.
- To open a .7z archive on Windows, you need https://www.7-zip.org/[7-Zip].

== 2. Installing W11Boost

TIP: If W11Boost fails to install, clear out your group policy edits by deleting `C:\Windows\System32\GroupPolicy\Machine\Registry.pol` and `C:\Windows\System32\GroupPolicy\User\Registry.pol`, then run `gpupdate /force` in Command Prompt as Administrator.

. Download and run the https://github.com/felikcat/W11Boost/releases[latest release of W11Boost]. +
Only Windows 10 version 1803 and newer are officially supported.

. Install https://winaerotweaker.com/[Winaero Tweaker] to set personal preferences.

. Download https://github.com/beatcracker/toptout/archive/refs/heads/master.zip[toptout] and open PowerShell as administrator:
- `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
- `.\topout_directory\examples\toptout_pwsh.ps1 -Env -Exec`
- `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Scope CurrentUser`

== 3. Recommendations

=== CPU
. Install https://bitsum.com/download-process-lasso/[Process Lasso] and use `Active Power Profile -> Bitsum Highest Performance` profile. +
Setting this power profile is not recommended for laptops, however there are other benefits to using Process Lasso.
. Check if the default process priority located in "Performance Options" -> "Advanced" -> "Processor scheduling" is set to "Programs". You can search "performance of Windows" in the Start Menu to locate where to open "Performance Options".
. Ensure Game Mode is on.
- Also: Optimizations for windowed games.

=== GPU
. To enable https://kernel.org/doc/html/next/gpu/amdgpu/display/mpo-overview.html[Multiplane Overlay] on NVIDIA cards; which makes Borderless Windowed the same speed as Fullscreen:
- Set your display's "Output color depth" to 8bpc.
image:nvcplui_1.png[]
- Do not use: custom resolutions, DSR, or scaling.

=== BIOS
* *Enable the following:*
. I/O APIC (IOAPIC 24-119 Entries)
. Above 4G Decoding and Resizable BAR.
** On ASRock motherboards: C.A.M. (Clever Access Memory)
. HPET (High Precision Event Timer)

=== Windows
. Keep the number of apps installed to a minimum, and remove unused apps. This reduces your chances of being impacted by https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-compromise-3cx-desktop-app-in-a-supply-chain-attack/[supply chain attacks], prevents causing Windows more issues, and might improve FPS stability.

. If you're okay with installing more software:
- Install https://www.startallback.com/[StartAllBack] to speed up Windows 11, and also restore old interface elements from Windows 7 or 10.
- Install https://github.com/Xanashi/Icaros[Icaros] for better and faster image & video thumbnails.

. Replace Consumer OEM apps with their Enterprise variant. Such as replacing Lenovo Vantage with Lenovo Commercial Vantage.

. Third-party anti-malware programs provide better protection, but may have flaws such as slowing down your internet speeds. Be sure to test before and after.

=== Ethernet
Avoid Realtek 2.5Gbit adapters, as they are much more CPU intensive than Intel 2.5Gbit adapters.

.Buying an Intel i225-V PCIe card
====
The Intel i225-V PCIe card tested is https://www.aliexpress.com/store/1100410590[IOCrest's variant], which works well our 6700k and 12700k PCs.

I have not tested https://www.aliexpress.com/store/1101345677/search?SearchText=i226[DERAPID's Intel i226-V PCIe cards], which are similarly priced and rate well.

=== Using fullscreen exclusive in games
Lowers input delay and GPU usage; potentially higher FPS, depending on the game.

.Drawbacks:
. Much higher time to switch between the game and another app (Alt + Tab).
. Increases chances of crashing games.

.How to:
. Unity engine; use the launch option: `-window-mode exclusive`
