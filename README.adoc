== About

If you like Atlas OS, this is a more modular and modern alternative. 

.By default, W11Boost's most important goals compared to red to alternatives are:
. Works on any Windows 10 or 11 installation. No need to reinstall.
. Clear and concise code, with full code transparency that's easy to read by newbie PowerShell programmers.
. Apps are selectively broken, but only if there are better alternatives.
. Enhances security without being slower.
. The easiest to use without sacrificing valuable features.
. Has semi-modularity. If you wish to break certain apps or drivers for more performance, you can do so on your own terms.
- Semi-modular due to groups of changes bundled together, rather than individual ones.

Like other optimizers, W11Boost has to be reapplied on every major Windows update, such as going from 21H2 to 22H2; W11Boost used to leverage Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to avoid this.

[%collapsible]
.Why is GPO now avoided?
====

. Importing other GPO files can override the prior GPOs, which was the case for applying DoD STIGs after installing W11Boost.
. Slows down boot-times drastically.
. The user cannot easily change GPOs, they would have to use a third-party program to remove or change them individually.
. Error reporting is poor, making it harder to debug W11Boost's issues.
. Overriden user preferences, such as a few settings you could use in Winaero Tweaker.

.*Performance*
. App startups are not tracked.

. Drivers and other system code are not paged to a disk. They are kept in memory instead, at the cost of higher memory usage.

. Exclusive fullscreen mode is allowed again.

. Enabled the following:
- Increased NTFS pool usage limit, reducing Windows' page-faults and stack usage. As a downside, RAM usage is increased.

- DXGI's DirectFlip with multi-plane overlay (MPO) enabled to lower input lag and reduce stuttering in games.

- Idle tickless for lower power draw, but also has performance benefits to real-time apps like DAWs or virtual machines, and foreground apps like video games.

- Enabled the BBRv2 TCP congestion control algorithm to minorly lower ping during excessive download or uploading, and improves ping for others connecting to your game or web servers on this PC.

- MemoryCompression reduces stuttering in video games by reducing the amount of writes to the paging file.

. Disabled the following:
- Power Throttling, as it caused severe performance reduction for VMWare Workstation 17.

- Analyzing application execution time.

- NTFS Last Access Time Stamp Updates; if needed, an application can explicitly update its own access timestamps.

- Fault Tolerant Heap. FTH can degrade an application's performance if it got marked for "crashing" too often; Assetto Corsa triggers this.

- Automatic offline maps updates.

- Explorer's thumbnail shadows. Makes folders with many photos or videos smoother to navigate.

- Searching disks to attempt fixing a missing shortcut.

- PageCombining to reduce CPU load and prevents https://kaimi.io/en/2020/07/reading-another-process-memory-via-windows-10-page-combining-en/[introducing security risks]; downside: increased RAM usage.

- Windows tips in general, such as "recommendations for tips, shortcuts, new apps, and more". This could be considered a usability issue as well for those already versed in using Windows.

. Disabled various forms of telemetry:
- Visual Studio 2022's PerfWatson2 (VSCEIP).
- Windows Error Reporting, Connected User Experiences and Telemetry, Diagnostic Policy Service, Cloud Content & Consumer Experience.
- Advertising ID for apps (.appx packaged).
- Feedback notifications.

. Disabled the following Scheduled Tasks:
- `Maintenance\WinSAT`: decides to measure overall PC performance at the worst times, drastically slowing down performance during its measurements.
- `MUI\LPRemove`: On boot-up, checks and removes unused language packs.
- `Power Efficiency Diagnostics\AnalyzeSystem`: Knowing this exists and looking for its results is on your part, very deliberate. It's better to manually run this to check for example, PCIe ASPM incompatibilities.
- `Windows\Autochk\Proxy`: An extension of "Microsoft Customer Experience Improvement Program" spyware.

. For Wi-Fi, other APs (Access Points) are never periodically scanned while currently connected to an AP.


.*Reliability*

. Windows Updates:
- Now only prompts for download then installation; updates are never automatic.
- Updates that Microsoft deems as causing compatibility issues are blocked.
- Opted out of "being the first to get the latest non-security updates".

. NTP time sync servers used are now 3 instead of 1, which are `time.cloudflare.com time.nist.gov time.windows.com` to reduce time sync failure.
** Important for Tor and 2FA codes from Bitwarden to remain working.

. UAC is enabled for both security, and fixing applications that break from UAC being off, such as Eddie-UI.

. Disabled the following:

- "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/shell/fast-user-switching[Fast User Switching]", as W11Boost is intended for single-user use only.

- Automated file cleanup that kicks in if disk space is running low.

- Fast startup (also called 'hybrid shutdown') due to stability issues, excessive disk usage, and could lower performance each "Fast startup" until Windows becomes a slow and janky mess.

- 'Wait For Link' on Ethernet adaptors. Can reduce time taken to establish a connection, and prevent drop-outs. Drop-outs were the case with Intel I225-V revision 1 and 2, but not 3.

- Microsoft's Malicious Removal Tool, which also has an issue of removing "malicious" files that other antivirus software like Kaspersky excluded.

. Enabled separating explorer.exe, one for the Windows Shell, the other for the File Explorer.

. Game Mode enabled to keep FPS consistent in games in certain situations, such as having OBS Studio recording your games.

. IPv6 is used whenever possible; avoids NAT and handles fragmentation locally instead of on the router, leading to higher performance and reliability.

. Enabled "smart multi-homed name resolution".
- Having this feature disabled can make DNS requests extremely slow, which some bad VPN apps do as a hack to prevent DNS leaks.

. Crash fix for apps using OpenSSL 1.0.2k (Jan 2017) or older; only applied if an Intel CPU is used.

. TCP timestamps enabled for increased reliability under bad network conditions.

. The default 2GB memory boundary is ensured for x86 apps.
- Prevent bugs or crashes with x86 apps that aren't specifically tested for LargeAddressAware (3GB limit).
- Manually patch apps with LAA if it's known to be beneficial, such as in GTA:SA.

.*Usability*

. Hidden file extensions are shown.
- If they're hidden, they are abused to hide the real file format for malicious purposes. Example: an executable (.exe, .scr) pretending to be a PDF.

. Apps are no longer automatically archived.
- Archived apps would take a long time to launch, as it needs to unarchived.

. The lock screen is replaced with the login screen.

. Windows is activated using the KMS38 method if it wasn't activated prior. This also prevents deactivation after hardware changes.

. Installs `winget` if missing or broken.

. Enabled NTFS long paths to prevent issues with Scoop and other apps.

. Ask to enter recovery options after 3 failed boots instead of forcing it.


.*Other*
. Importing/setting wallpapers is set to 100% of JPEG's quality; less compression, therefore less "blurriness".

== Installing W11Boost

. https://github.com/felikcat/W11Boost/archive/refs/heads/master.zip[Download W11Boost] then extract it.

. Temporarily disable your anti-virus / anti-malware.

. Open `Run.bat`, then click "Install W11Boost".

== Recommended apps
NOTE: Some Windows functions are deliberately broken, such as System Restore, File History, and Remote Assistance. +
Reason: There are better alternatives.

. File History: https://www.resilio.com/individuals/[Resilio Sync]
. System Restore: https://www.macrium.com/reflectfree[Macrium Reflect]
. Remote Assistance: https://rustdesk.com/[RustDesk] or https://anydesk.com/en[AnyDesk]

== Background information on the Extras

=== Microsoft app debloater
. Replicates what Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 includes by default, which is known to only include what's important.
- *Exclusions*:
** Due to breaking apps: App Installer, Store Experience Host, Windows Store, Xbox Game Speech Window.
** Due to being high-quality, and not funneling advertisements or towards using a Microsoft account: Camera, Clock, Terminal, Maps, Phone Link.

=== Install Xbox services
. This is meant for a de-bloated Windows installation, or for an LTSC variant of Windows.

. Login to the Microsoft Store before using `Install_Xbox_Minimal.bat`!

. Installs only what's required to support Xbox Controllers (GUI/interface not included, get it link://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NBLGGH30XJ3[here]), Microsoft's PC Game Pass, and specific games such as Forza Horizon 4 & 5.
- To also get the Game Bar, install the following link://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NZKPSTSNW4P[here] then link://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NBLGGH537C2[here].

=== Install STIG policies
. Enforces a higher base-line of security via https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/[DoD STIG compliance], that still avoids breaking apps.

. This cannot be a perfect replica, as it's local only.
- This will not attach to an Active Directory hosted either locally via a Windows Server, or an online server via Microsoft Entra ID (called "Azure AD" prior).


== Recommendations

.*`Advanced.ps1` can disable Game DVR, remove Microsoft Edge and remove various forms of automation, etc.*
* However, configuring `Advanced.ps1` is required:
. Open `Advanced.ps1` in a text editor or IDE of your choosing. +
. After finished, run `Advanced.ps1` as Administrator. 
- No help will be provided on how to do this.

=== Using fullscreen exclusive in games.
Lowers input delay and GPU usage; potentially higher FPS, depending on the game.

.Drawbacks:
. Much higher time to switch between the game and another app (Alt + Tab).
. Increases chances of crashing games.

.How to:
. Unity engine; use the launch option: `-window-mode exclusive`

=== Ethernet
Avoid Realtek 2.5Gbit adapters, as they are much more CPU intensive than Intel 2.5Gbit adapters.

.My test results - with pictures
[%collapsible]
====

- Intel i225-V rev3 (important, as older revisions have serious issues):

.Buying an Intel i225-V PCIe card
====
The Intel i225-V PCIe card tested is https://www.aliexpress.com/store/1100410590[IOCrest's variant], which works well our 6700k and 12700k PCs.
image:IOCrest_i225-V3_purchase.png[]
image:Intel_HID.png[]

I have not tested https://www.aliexpress.com/store/1101345677/search?SearchText=i226[DERAPID's Intel i226-V PCIe cards], which are similarly priced and rate well.
====

=== GPU
. To enable https://kernel.org/doc/html/next/gpu/amdgpu/display/mpo-overview.html[Multiplane Overlay] on NVIDIA cards:
- Set your display's "Output color depth" to 8bpc.
image:nvcplui_1.png[]
- Do not use: custom resolutions, DSR, or scaling.

=== BIOS
* *Enable the following:*
. I/O APIC (IOAPIC 24-119 Entries)
. Above 4G Decoding and Resizable BAR.
** On ASRock motherboards: C.A.M. (Clever Access Memory)
. HPET (High Precision Event Timer)


=== Windows
. Keep the number of apps installed to a minimum, and remove unused apps. This reduces your chances of being impacted by https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-compromise-3cx-desktop-app-in-a-supply-chain-attack/[supply chain attacks], prevents causing Windows more issues, and might improve FPS stability.

. Replace Consumer OEM apps with their Enterprise variant. Such as replacing Lenovo Vantage with Lenovo Commercial Vantage.

. Use Windows Defender, installing alternatives can impact various types of performance such as networking greatly, or even the stability of Windows.
- Context: Kaspersky reduced the download speeds of my Thinkpad P15 Gen 1 (released 2021) from 882.70mbps to 192.67mbps, and the Windows Security Service would do a constant ~8% CPU usage that noticeably shortened the battery life of this laptop.
