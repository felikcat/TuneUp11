W11Boost speeds up Windows 10 & 11, keeps FPS and ping in games consistent, brings back privacy without breaking any apps or programs, and if needed permanently activates Windows.


[%collapsible]
.Be specific about what W11Boost does.

====

This section is lazily done; see the code starting from `W11Boost.ps1` as the documentation is there.

** Changes are tunneled through the Group Policy Editor, therefore:
*** Windows Update does not revert W11Boost's changes.
*** W11Boost's changes can be viewed from a graphical interface via `rsop.msc`. +
image:RSOP.png[]
*** W11Boost can *mostly* be reverted/uninstalled with two commands using PowerShell:
. `Remove-Item -Path "$env:windir\System32\GroupPolicy" -Recurse -Force`
. `gpupdate.exe /force`

** W11Boost and a third-party script it pulls in (https://github.com/beatcracker/toptout[toptout]) are fully open-source. Meaning you can read through the code, the comments, and some documentation provided.
*** Closed-source exceptions: 'https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/f4a33deebc499ae70e479ba75b6161cae9e1626d852af7a40b96c7d69207e607?nocache=1[PolFileEditor.dll]'.

== Extras

TIP: Login to the Microsoft Store before using `Install_Xbox_Minimal.bat`, otherwise it will not work. +
To also get the Game Bar, install the following link://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NZKPSTSNW4P[here] then link://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NBLGGH537C2[here].

. `W11_LTSC_Replica.bat`
* De-bloats Windows 11 enough to replicate what Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 includes by default, which is known to only include what's important.
*** *Exceptions* to prevent breaking apps or programs: App Installer, Store Experience Host, Windows Store, Xbox Game Speech Window.

. `Install_Xbox_Minimal.bat`
- Installs only what's required to support Xbox Controllers (GUI/interface not included, get it link://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NBLGGH30XJ3[here]), Microsoft's PC Game Pass, and specific games such as Forza Horizon 4 & 5.
- This is made specifically for LTSC or if `W11_LTSC_Replica.bat` was used.

. `Advanced.bat`
** Contains a lot of extra features for those that know what's desired. Not meant for usage on PCs you don't personally use.
*** Configuring `Advanced.ps1` is required: +
1. Open `Advanced.ps1` in a text editor or IDE of your choosing. +
2. After finished, run `Advanced.bat` as Administrator.


== Recommendations

=== BIOS
* *Enable the following:*
. I/O APIC (IOAPIC 24-119 Entries)
. Above 4G Decoding and Resizable BAR.
** On ASRock motherboards: C.A.M. (Clever Access Memory)
** This is incompatible with Windows installed on an MBR partition; if Windows can no longer boot, this setting caused it.
. HPET (High Precision Event Timer)

* *Disable the following:*
. XHCI Hands Off
. USB Legacy
** link://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-usb-blog/reasons-to-avoid-companion-controllers/ba-p/270710[Why disable these two?] +
Note: if a USB is no longer bootable after these two changes, turn them both back on.


=== Windows
. Keep the number of programs installed to a minimum. This reduces your chances of being impacted by https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-compromise-3cx-desktop-app-in-a-supply-chain-attack/[supply chain attacks] and to prevent causing Windows more issues.

. Install all optional updates through Windows Update; it can include device drivers.

. Replace Consumer OEM programs with their Enterprise variant. Such as replacing Lenovo Vantage with Lenovo Commercial Vantage.
