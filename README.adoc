== Notes
* Does not overwrite user preferences that decrease privacy, except for those with a noticeable performance impact.
** It's assumed third-party tools do this job better.

* Gets rid of some of the auto-piloting that accumulatively is intensive on system resources, such as the link:https://admx.help/?Category=Windows_11_2022&Policy=Microsoft.Policies.ApplicationCompatibility::AppCompatTurnOffEngine[Application Compatibility Engine].
** For ACE being off specifically, you would manually specify to run a legacy application in compatibility mode (likely for Windows XP).

== Requirements
* Windows has to be activated for some changes, use your license key, or use...

*** If that didn't work: https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts

== Instructions
. link:https://github.com/nermur/W11Boost/archive/refs/heads/master.zip[Download W11Boost], then extract it.
. Configure the options located inside `W11Boost.bat`, then run it as Administrator.

NOTE: Disable all anti-virus software before running `W11Boost.bat`.

== Recommendations

=== Tweaks
* Enable the following options in your motherboard's BIOS:
** I/O APIC (IOAPIC 24-119 Entries)
** Above 4G Decoding
** Resizable BAR [NOTE: If Windows cannot boot (due to using MBR instead of GPT), disable this]

* Disable the following options in your motherboard's BIOS:
** XHCI Hands Off
** USB Legacy

Note: if a USB is no longer bootable after these two changes, temporarily turn them both back on.

* Kaspersky is the best "anti-virus" in terms of performance + protection; you can get it for much cheaper from Amazon or other third-party markets.

* Enable "User Account Control" if it's disabled; disabled will break some software, such as: link:https://eddie.website/[AirVPN's client].

* Windows Settings -> Gaming -> Enable "Game Mode"
** -> Graphics -> Change default graphics settings -> Enable "Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling", "Variable refresh rate", and "Optimizations for windowed games"

=== Software
* link:https://www.oo-software.com/en/shutup10[ShutUp10]
** A privacy enhancer that doesn't break software.

* link:https://github.com/WereDev/Wu10Man[Wu10Man]
** Safely fully disables and enables Windows Update whenever, with no need to reboot for changes.

* link:https://github.com/jbara2002/windows-defender-remover[Windows Defender Remover]
** Disables (recommended), or removes Windows Defender.
*** Removing Windows Defender will break updates; you'd have to manually update through Microsoft's Update Catalog instead.

** Extensive number of usability and visual tweaks.

* link:https://www.speedguide.net/downloads.php[SG TCP Optimizer]
** Gets higher speeds and lower latency out of your network connection.

* link:https://dl.bitsum.com/files/processlassosetup64.exe[Process Lasso]
** Better thread scheduling (for specific CPUs) and the best power plan for gaming ("Bitsum Highest Performance").

TIP: If you ever removed Power Profiles, run `powercfg -restoredefaultschemes` before installing Process Lasso, otherwise "Bitsum Highest Performance" can't apply.
