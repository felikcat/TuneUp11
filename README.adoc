== Notice
* W11Boost exceeds DoNotSpy11, W10Privacy, and O&O ShutUp 10 combined in the extensiveness and quality of its tweaks.
** W11Boost's primary issues are the lack of configuration, partial support for Windows 10 LTSC 2022, and no GUI.
*** Originally this was being moved into a Qt6 GUI, along with taking advantage of C++'s capabilities, but will not be completed since I switched to only using Arch Linux.

License is WTFPL, if you want to make something cool out of this then go ahead.


== About
W11Boost goes after maximum performance, reduces the amount of distractions, and avoids breaking programs.

.User notes
[%collapsible]
====
* Does not overwrite user preferences that decrease privacy, except for those with a noticeable performance impact, or can be distracting/annoying.
** It's assumed third-party tools do this job better, and not everyone wants to disable components that have privacy concerns.

* What is repaired:
** Mistakes made by other optimizers.

* Only Windows 10 LTSC 2022, Windows 11 Pro 21H2, and Windows 11 Enterprise 22H2 have been tested.

====

.Developer notes
[%collapsible]
====

* `reg.exe add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EXAMPLE" /v "Start" /t REG_DWORD /d 4 /f` is preferred over using `sc.exe config EXAMPLE start=disabled` since Windows rejects this request depending on the service.

* MMCSS (Multimedia Class Scheduler) doesn't exist in Windows 10 LTSC 2022 and newer.

* Non-volatile registry keys usually don't self-regenerate themselves if their key doesn't exist.
** If the purpose is to revert back to defaults, manually set the default value instead.

* The registry changes Group Policy edits do can be traced with link://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon[Sysinternals Process Monitor].
** Filter to the process containing gpedit.msc: +
image:Procmon64_1.png[]
** Filter to registry changes only: +
image:Procmon64_2.png[]
*** Translate the traced registry edits to their non-group policy places, and there's your registry key edit.
**** Other processes of interest: +
`SystemPropertiesPerformance.exe`, `SystemSettings.exe`, `DllHost.exe` +
`SecurityHealthService.exe`

TIP: Example gpedit.msc registry translation: +

== Before continuing

. It's assumed that:
** Disabling some components are ignored on Windows versions that aren't Enterprise/Education/Server SKUs, especially regarding telemetry.
** You have to reapply W11Boost after major Windows feature updates, such as going from 21H2 -> 22H2.
** Windows can at any time decide to revert single or multiple changes done by this script.
*** Use link:https://github.com/henrypp/simplewall/releases[Simplewall] to prevent this.
** You can handle Windows without its auto-piloting features, such as the link://admx.help/?Category=Windows_11_2022&Policy=Microsoft.Policies.ApplicationCompatibility::AppCompatTurnOffEngine[Application Compatibility Engine].
*** For ACE being off specifically, you would manually specify to run a legacy application in compatibility mode (likely for Windows XP).

== Requirements
. Windows has to be activated for some changes; use a license key, or run either link://github.com/abbodi1406/KMS_VL_ALL_AIO[abbodi1406's KMS_VL_ALL_AIO] or massgravel's link://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts[Microsoft Activation Scripts].

. Windows Package Manager is installed and functional.
** For Windows 11, open PowerShell and run `winget`; if it's working:
*** Open the Microsoft Store, then update "App Installer" through it.

** For Windows 10 LTSC 2019 or 2022, run in Command Prompt as Administrator to install `winget`:
*** `wsreset -i`
*** If the Microsoft store doesn't show up after this command is complete, reboot.
*** Open the Microsoft Store, then install "App Installer" through it.


== Instructions
. Download the link:https://github.com/nermur/W11Boost/releases[latest W11Boost], then extract it.
. Configure the options by editing `main.ps1`.
. Temporarily disable all anti-virus programs.
. Run `Backup_Registry.bat` as Administrator a single time; only redo this after an update to a new major OS version (such as 21H2 -> 22H2)
. Run `W11Boost.bat` as Administrator.

== Extras
* `W11_LTSC_2022.bat`
** Uninstalls a lot of default apps to replicate what Windows 10 LTSC 2022 includes by default.
*** Exceptions: App Installer, Store Experience Host, Windows Store, Windows Terminal, Xbox Game Speech Window.
*** Warning: Run this first before other extras if you plan on using it.

* `Install_Xbox_Minimal.bat`
** Note: Login to the Microsoft Store before using this script, otherwise it will not work.
** Installs only what's required to use Xbox Controllers (interface not included, get it link://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NBLGGH30XJ3[here]), Game Pass, and specific games like Forza Horizon 4 & 5.
*** To also get Game Bar, install the following link://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NZKPSTSNW4P[here] and link://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NBLGGH537C2[here].

== Recommendations

=== Tweaks
. Enable the following options in your motherboard's BIOS:
* I/O APIC (IOAPIC 24-119 Entries)
* Above 4G Decoding
* Resizable BAR
** NOTE: If Windows cannot boot (likely from using MBR instead of GPT), disable Resizable BAR.
* HPET (High Precision Event Timer)

. Disable the following options in your motherboard's BIOS:
* XHCI Hands Off
* USB Legacy
** link://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-usb-blog/reasons-to-avoid-companion-controllers/ba-p/270710[Why disable these two?] +
Note: if a USB is no longer bootable after these two changes, temporarily turn them both back on.

. Windows Settings -> Gaming -> Enable "Game Mode"
* -> Graphics -> Change default graphics settings -> Enable "Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling", "Variable refresh rate", and "Optimizations for windowed games"

. Install all optional updates through Windows Update; it can include device drivers.

. Auto-detect and install link://www.amd.com/en/support[AMD's drivers]. +
Auto-detect and install link://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html[Intel's drivers].
* This will utilize their drivers instead of the generic drivers Microsoft provides, meaning better performance and lower DPC latency.


=== Replace problematic programs

This contains a long but important list. Be sure to check it if you're not sure.
